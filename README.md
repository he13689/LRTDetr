# LRTDetr
the official implement of LRTDETR. LRT-DETR: Lite Real-Time DETR for Multi-Scale Algae Detection.

1.Multi-channel downsample block captures low-level algae features effectively.

2.Hierarchical fusion encoder fuses multi-scale features with fewer parameters.

3.Generalized Algae Intersection over Union provides stable gradients for model optimization.

4.LRT-DETR delivers top performance at real time algae detection.
