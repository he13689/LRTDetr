# LRTDetr
the official implement of LRTDETR. LRT-DETR: Lite Real-Time DETR for Multi-Scale Algae Detection.

Multi-channel downsample block captures low-level algae features effectively.
Hierarchical fusion encoder fuses multi-scale features with fewer parameters.
Generalized Algae Intersection over Union provides stable gradients for model optimization.
LRT-DETR delivers top performance at real time algae detection.
